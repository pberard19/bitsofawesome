    <h1>Pat Berard</h1>

    <p>
      Hi, I'm Pat. I make software. I do full stack but I lean towards the backend.
      I also make pies and play trumpet. That usually doesn't happen at my desk though.
	</p>

	<p>
	  I'm currently a software engineer in Chicago helping people look awesome in some great clothes.
	  <br>

	<h3>Me In A Nutshell</h3>
	<p>	
	  I like the things that challenge me.  I got into programming because it challenged the very way I thought, and there are always new problems to face. Honestly I'm much more interested in making giant robots, but I've been told that those are 'impractical' and 'physically impossible due to the 
	  limits of modern material engineering'. So I'll settle for coding.<br><br>

	  I also like to go outside occasionally to bike, run, swim, or frolf.  I have also been known to play video games, trumpet, and D&D.  Things I'm currently reading about are Statistics and Data Science because math is fun.
	  
    </p>
	<h3>My Coding Philosophy</h3>
	<p>
		I am an advocater of the Keep It Simple, Silly (KISS) method.  Not all problems have simple solutions, but the mark of a great programmer is the ability to convey the solution in a simple manner so others can understand it. If you win the lottery tomorrow, will others be able to maintain your code? Will you be able to read your own code in a year? 6 months from now? 3 weeks from now?
		<br>
		Good comments, clear code, and well organized programs help me sleep at night.
